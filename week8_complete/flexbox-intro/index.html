                <p> The city’s central computer told you? R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange

                <p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code
                    as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan)</p>

                <p>Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness,
                impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall)</p>
